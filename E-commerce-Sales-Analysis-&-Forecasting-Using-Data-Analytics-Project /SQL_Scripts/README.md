## üìã Overview  

In this part of the project, I will be mentioning the **details of the SQL queries** used for data processing and analysis in **pgAdmin 4**. These queries help in **data extraction, transformation, and exploratory analysis** of e-commerce sales data stored in **PostgreSQL**.  

The key objectives of these queries are:  
‚úî Cleaning and preparing the data  
‚úî Extracting business insights  
‚úî Identifying customer purchasing trends  
‚úî Analyzing product and sales performance  
‚úî Evaluating shipping and return patterns
